1. If you want to bot on Sword/Shield, download [USB-Botbase from Koi-3088's fork](https://github.com/Koi-3088/USB-Botbase/releases). If you want to bot on Let's Go Pikachu/Eevee, download [USB-Botbase from my fork](https://github.com/Manu098vm/USB-Botbase/releases). Copy the the ``atmosphere`` folder to the root of your SD card, reboot your Switch to CFW and connect your console via a USB cable to your computer.
1. Download [Zadig](http://www.unitrunker.com/zadig.html), open it, click on ``Options`` -> ``List all devices``. Select `Nintendo Switch`, choose `libusbK`, click `Replace/Reinstall`. Your driver should now be `libusbK` instead of `WinUSB`.
1. Download and install [libusb filters](http://www.mediafire.com/file/wdx5lu4c37sm1cv/libusb-win32-devel-filter-1.2.6.0.exe/file). Open the program, click ``Install a device filter``, select your Nintendo Switch.
1. On your computer, go to ``Start`` > ``Device Manager``, scroll down until you see ``libusbK Devices``, right click your device, select ``Properties``, and make note of your USB port without the leading zeroes. This should be added to the configuration when setting up a bot.
